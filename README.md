# 🌦️ Temperature Prediction Using Humidity

This project applies a **simple linear regression model** to predict temperature from humidity data.

## 🔍 Objective
To analyze the relationship between humidity and temperature and build a regression model for prediction.

## 🧠 Tools Used
Python · Pandas · NumPy · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results
- The linear regression model captured a clear linear trend.
- For more complex patterns, polynomial or time-series models can be explored.

## 💼 Internship Information
This project was completed as part of my **Skillfied Internship in Data Science and Machine Learning**.
